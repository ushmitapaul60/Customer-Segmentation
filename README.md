# Customer-Segmentation

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The goal of this project is to implement an unsupervised learning technique to perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior. Using clustering, we aim to group customers into distinct segments: for example, high-value customers who make frequent or large purchases and other segments of customers who make less frequent or smaller purchases. This segmentation will help in understanding diverse customer groups, enabling targeted marketing strategies and enhancing customer engagement.

# WORK FLOW

Customer Data -> Data Pre-processing -> Data Analysis -> Optimum number of Clusters -> KMeans Clustering -> Visualizing the data
Data set- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data

# Within cluster sum of squares (WCSS) #
It is used which is a statistical measurement that determines the variability of observations within a cluster. 
The Elbow Method technique is used which is  used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) in k-means clustering.
1. Calculate WCSS for different K values.
2. Plot the WCSS vs. K
3. Identify the elbow point.
